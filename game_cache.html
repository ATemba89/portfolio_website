                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Gaming is an immersive escape that continues to grow with its audience.
                    It’s industry has generated over $180 billion US dollars as of 2024, with
                    mobile games <br>
                    earning over $90 billion US . With 3.2 billion gamers world-wide,
                    creating an app that is easy to access from a mobile device stirs a pot for
                    potential in reaching<br>
                    a massive and enthusiastic fan base by becoming a top choice
                    that users refer to when their focus leads to gaming for fun.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>Rationale</h1>
                <p>Gaming has been a huge part of my life since childhood and as an
                    adult continues to excite my imagination. Responsibilities have increased
                    for most adults that<br>
                    have risen through the era of gaming and although finding time to dedicate is
                    a challenge, staying informed with new releases and revisiting older ones can
                    sometimes <br>
                    be enough. Game Cache serves to reignite the collector and imaginative
                    innocence still in the wings.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h1>Problem</h1>
                <p>There are so many gaming titles that exist. Finding a database of games could be
                    overwhelming, especially for novice or casual game players. <br>
                    Questions that were
                    often brought up during the process were:
                <ul>
                    <li>How can the app appear fun for those who no longer play games like when they were younger?</li>
                    <li>Gaming choices can be overwhelming. How can the app cater to those that prefer simple and custom
                        browsing methods?</li>

                </ul>
                </p>


                <div>
                    <h1>Solution</h1>
                    <p>An app that offers reviews, information and screenshots of games for audiences of all levels to
                        interact with.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating a “bright and fun” interface that is easy to navigate.</li>
                        <li>Customizable options that speak to all levels of Gamers.</li>
                        <li>Easy navigation</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h1>Key Features</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create User Profiles.</li>
                        <li>Information on games and their respective platforms.</li>
                        <li>Joining gmaing communities based off favorite game genres.</li>
                        <li>Saving games to a collection list.</li>
                    </ul>



                </div>

                <div>
                    <h1>Who?</h1>
                    <p>Late teens to older adults (17-55) occasional to avid gamers,
                        who like to stay on top of gaming platforms and new to old releases of video games.</p><br>

                    <h1>What?</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Join gaming communities</li>
                        <li>Create a user Profile</li>
                        <li>Discover games ranging from most gaming platforms </li>
                        <li>Publish gameplay content and photos</li>
                        <li>Follow Profiles</li>
                        <li>Rate and review games</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>When?</h1>
                    <p>Whether you are on the go or taking some time off the on sofa, the app will be available to use
                        at your own leisure.</p><br>

                    <h1>Where?</h1>
                    <p>The app will be available for the mobile IOS and Android systems.</p><br>

                    <h1>Why?</h1>
                    <p>The act of gaming continues to evolve, but the method of handheld interaction has always been a
                        constant. <br>
                        Accessing the app through a mobile (or tablet) continues the tradition. Games are also included
                        on mobile devices, so<br>
                        switching between the app and gameplay would be a key feature for users.</p><br>


                </div>
                <div>
                    <h1>Approach</h1>
                    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
                    <p>Aside from my personal experience and desire for the app, I knew that there had to be similar
                        apps on the market that offered similar functions. <br>
                        Researching similar apps would help me to narrow down what would help my app to stand out as
                        well as what commonalities it would need in order to be consistent and familiar to potential
                        users.</p><br>
                    <h2>Stash/MyGames Database</h2>
                    <p>Both games feature a variety of functions that earn it a place amongst game collecting apps.
                        Perhaps Stash holds the most functions for engagement, but MyGames DB excels in its minimalism
                        and practicality.</p>

                    <h1>Requirements</h1>
                    <h2>Designing for both IOS and Android systems</h2>
                    <p>In addition to conducting market research, it was necessary to research the guidelines for both
                        operating systems. This added another dimension to building a familiar <br>
                        aspect to the design. Not only do the apps functions have to be consistent for Users, but the
                        way they interact with different operating systems was equally important</p>

                </div>

                <div>
                    <h1>Problem</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying which design elements should be present as a reflection of a specific system, and when can they be completely original elements.</li><br>
                        <li>Keeping the design space open despite the need of multiple functions.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h1>Goal</h1>
                        <ul>
                        <li>To analyze the design of  two similar apps in order to solve  problems I’ve encountered in my wireframes. </li><br>
                        <li>Ultimately develop a design that is familiar, yet maintains its own identity.</li>
                        </ul>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h1>Solutions</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding helpful text can break up the pattern in a positive way, guiding and reassuring the user.</li><br>
                        <li>Many design patterns exist that I can gain inspiration from when having to fit many elements onto a screen. <br>Creating a clean layout and following a pattern can help my screens to appear aligned and easy to navgiate.</li><br>
                        <li>Researhing apps for both IOS and Android systems  can help me understand how to design for both systems<br> and see how designers are able to find their style within a set guideline and where certain components can be placed.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>The User is able to login or create an account as efficiently as possible. I wanted the sign up process to be as easy as possible and introduce the user to the overall feel of the app.<br>

                    <h1>Low and Mid Fidelity wireframes</h1>
                    <p>The use of low and mid wireframes were significant in the process because I was able to map out what elements my screen needed to have. I relied heavily on the use of components created for  Material Android and IOS systems to create functional and consistent screens.</p>

                <div>
                    <h1>User Feedback</h1>
                    <p>The use of low and mid wireframes were significant in the process because I was able to map out what elements my screen needed to have. I relied heavily on the use of componenets created for  Material Android and IOS systems to create functional and consistent screens.</p>

                <div>
                    <h1>Takeaways</h1>
                    <p>When adhering to specific operating systems, it’s important to do as much research as possible.  
                        In the case of this project, asking friends to who may use <br>operating systems 
                        different from yours to really gage how the app appears on other screens and how 
                        Users may need to adapt to the design. Comparing the final<br> design to the original, 
                        I was overall happy with the progress. Sometimes whitespace gives the impression 
                        that it needs to be filled,  which I had to learn is not always<br>the case. But for my
                         final designs, the addition of floating elements were minimal enough to maintain a 
                         balance within the layout. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
<h1>Improvements</h1>
<p>The users first interaction with the app occurs when they first enter. 
    That introduction is crucial in establishing a rapport. For this app, 
    I would refine the layout and allow <br>for more space in the login screens. 
    The floating elements were fun to create. I would be a bit more meticulous 
    in there shapes and their placement so that they enhance the<br> crucial elements
     and text and don’t clash with them. The addition of more functions on the homepage 
     I feel could help broaden the app in terms of what it offers. I think that <br>more
      helpful text or more functions that the User can interact with would help promote
       the app’s objective.</p>
